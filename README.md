### WHY USE JUSTINMIND
JustInMind became my choice wire-framing tool as a result of the following reasons:
- It houses all that is required to fully bring out the design picture in my mind (color picker, widgets, icons, shapes, text editor, navigation, menus e.t.c).
- It is featured for both mobile and the web.
- This tool allows one to prototype one's design and making it highly interactive.
- I must say that its users experience is really great as I found it really easy to use without having to go through series of tutorials.
